## Overview

This project involved the development of a footwear brand website as part of an agency collaboration, with a full Figma-to-WordPress implementation. The design and content were provided by the agency, while my role focused on translating the Figma layouts into a pixel-accurate and fully functional WordPress website.

I handled the complete frontend development, ensuring visual consistency with the original design while maintaining clean structure, usability, and performance across all devices.

## Key Features

- **Figma to WordPress Translation**: Faithful conversion of provided Figma designs into WordPress templates with close attention to spacing, typography, and layout details.
- **Custom Frontend Development**: Implementation of custom CSS, animations, and interactive elements to match the intended design behavior.
- **Responsive Refinement**: Detailed optimization for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints to ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Hosting & Deployment**: Setup of the hosting environment and final deployment of the website.

## Technologies Used

- **WordPress**: CMS used for content management and template structure.
- **Custom CSS**: For fine-grained visual control and layout accuracy.
- **JavaScript**: Used for animations and interactive behaviors.
- **Responsive Design Techniques**: Media queries and layout adjustments for cross-device compatibility.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was maintaining pixel-level accuracy while adapting the design to real-world responsive constraints. Translating complex layouts and interactions from static Figma files into a flexible WordPress environment required careful refinement across breakpoints, as well as balancing design fidelity with performance and maintainability.

## Outcome

The final result is a clean and reliable WordPress website that closely reflects the original Figma design. The project demonstrates strong execution in Figma-to-WordPress workflows, frontend precision, and responsive implementation within an agency-driven production environment.
