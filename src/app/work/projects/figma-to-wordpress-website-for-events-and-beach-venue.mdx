## Overview

This project involved the development of a WordPress website for a beach venue centered around events, tourism, and nightlife. The work was carried out as part of an agency collaboration, with a Figma-to-WordPress implementation designed to support event promotion and seasonal content.

I focused on frontend development, translating the provided Figma layouts into a clean, lightweight, and responsive WordPress experience.

## Key Features

- **Figma to WordPress Implementation**: Accurate frontend translation of the provided Figma design into WordPress.
- **Elementor Pro & Custom CSS**: Use of Elementor Pro combined with custom CSS for layout control and visual refinement.
- **Responsive Optimization**: Careful adaptation across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Subtle animations and interactions to enhance user experience without impacting performance.
- **Event-Oriented Content**: Integration of image galleries, embedded maps, and structured event-related content.
- **Hosting & Deployment**: Hosting configuration and final deployment of the website.

## Technologies Used

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was maintaining visual consistency while keeping the website lightweight and performant, especially given the media-heavy nature of event and venue websites. This project reinforced the importance of balancing aesthetics, responsiveness, and performance in promotional platforms.

## Outcome

The final result is a visually consistent and responsive WordPress website tailored for event promotion and tourism. The platform effectively supports seasonal content, galleries, and venue information while maintaining clarity, performance, and usability.
